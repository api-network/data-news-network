description: At Mendeley Data, we believe when data is openly available, the pace of scientific discovery is increased - researchers can verify findings, or reuse data to generate new findings. When you make your data openly available, it increases confidence in your conclusions, and can potentially lead to more citations. All this means funding agencies and publishers are increasingly asking for data to be shared. We knew we needed to provide a data sharing solution for our community, so Mendeley Data was launched in 2015, to enable researchers to post research data, gain greater exposure, and track usage of their data.
