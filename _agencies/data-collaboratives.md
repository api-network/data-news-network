description: Data Collaboratives are a new form of collaboration, beyond the public-private partnership model, in which participants from different sectors — in particular companies -  exchange their data to create public value. Solving today’s challenges — from addressing climate change to public health to job creation —will  require greater access to data that resides within the private sector —e.g., click histories, online purchases, sensor data, and call detail records. To fulfill the potential of data to improve people’s lives, we need to accelerate the creation and use of “Data Collaboratives”.
