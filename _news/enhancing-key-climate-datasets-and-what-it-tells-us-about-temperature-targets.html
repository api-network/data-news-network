name: Enhancing key climate datasets and what it tells us about temperature targets
description: Research groups around the world provide updates of global surface temperatures that are critical to evaluating climate change trends. They differ based on starting year, corrections made to changing measurement techniques, and how they deal with gaps between measurement locations. Crucially, all show similar levels of warming over the past 150 years â€“ between 1 degree and 1.2 degrees above pre-industrial levels; every 0.1 degree matters.
