name: Archaeology is going digital to harness the power of Big Data
description: Archaeology is finally catching up with the so-called digital humanities, as evidenced by a February special edition of the Journal of Field Archaeology, devoted entirely to discussing the myriad ways in which large-scale datasets and associated analytics are transforming the field. The papers included in the edition were originally presented during a special session at a 2019 meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. The data sets might be a bit smaller than those normally associated with Big Data, but this new digital data gaze is nonetheless having a profound impact on archaeological research.
